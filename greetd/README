This branch can be started from a rooted tty shell.
Currently tested is the included agreety (minimal) greeter.

Can start a shell, X, or anything. This is my config.toml

############### /etc/greetd/config.toml
[terminal]
# The VT to run the greeter on. Can be "next", "current" or a number
vt = 2

[default_session]
#command = "sway --config /etc/greetd/sway-config"
command = "agreety --cmd start-sway"
user = "greeter"
############### End of file
